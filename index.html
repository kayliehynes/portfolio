        Hello! My name is Kaylie Hynes, I am a senior Information Technology student at Pace University Seidenberg School Of 
        Computer Science and Information Systems. This portfolio showcases my journey into software development, computer science, and 
        finally law, which is an industry I am aspiring to get into.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an aspiring lawyer in the Tech industry, I am constantly learning and expanding my skills in both computer science and coding. On
        this site, you'll find information about my background, the jobs I've worked, and my extracurricular activities. I believe 
        that my work as a lawyer in the Tech field will make a positive impact, and I am excited to share my work with you and others.
