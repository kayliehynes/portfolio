    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/Screenshot 2023-04-01 at 8.50.40 PM.png" alt="Kaylie Hynes" class="profile-image">
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Kaylie Hynes, I am a senior Information Technology student at Pace University Seidenberg School Of 
        Computer Science and Information Systems. This portfolio showcases my journey into software development, computer science, and 
        finally law, which is an industry I am aspiring to get into.
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout my four years at Pace University, I have maintained a 3.2 GPA while actively working two part-time jobs and hold two 
        leadership positions on the Data Science and Criminal Justice Clubs. These experiences have not only sharpened my time management
        skills, but has taught me value in teamwork and how to work hard for my future in the techn industry.
    </p>


    <h3>Extracurricular Activities</h3>

    <p> Outside of my coursework, I am an active member of the Criminal Justice and Data Science club, I previously was head of
        Public Relations and the Secretary for the Criminal Justice Club. In this role, I have had to organize workshops and reach out
        to professors and officers to schedule the guest speakers for our meetings.
    </p>
    <p> I am also studying for the LSAT and am in the process of Law School applications for the Fall of 2025. I am passionate
        about my future career goals so in between all of my other requirements and studies, I am actively studying for the Law School
        Admissions Test. This experience has shown my time management skills and has also taught me a different type of logic that 
        needs to be used when taking the test.
    </p>

    <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>

    <p>
        When I am not coding or studying, you can find me at Corepower Yoga in Tribeca or NoHo. I also enjoy baking and cooking new 
        recipes at home with my sister. These diverse interests help me maintain a calm and well-rounded perspective on both my 
        personal and professional life. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm excited about my future as a lawyer and expanding my knowledge in the Tech industry and my role in shaping it. If you'd like
        to connect or learn about my experiences, please reach out to me via media links or email!
